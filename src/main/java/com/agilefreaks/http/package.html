<p>
HTTPBuilder provides a simple Groovy API for HTTP and REST client operations.
 It supports multiple callbacks based on response status code, and a mechanism
 to automatically parse and encode many common content-types such as XML, JSON,
 HTML, and plain text.  HTTPBuilder also supports easy configuration for common
 authentication mechanisms, and common content-encodings as well.
</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
    The primary class is {@link com.agilefreaks.http.HTTPBuilder HTTPBuilder}, which
    provides the most features and functionality.
    {@link com.agilefreaks.http.RESTClient RESTClient},
    {@link com.agilefreaks.http.AsyncHTTPBuilder AsyncHTTPBuilder} and
    {@link com.agilefreaks.http.HttpURLClient HttpURLClient} are variants provided
    for more specialized use cases.
</p>

<p>{@link com.agilefreaks.http.URIBuilder URIBuilder} is used by HTTPBuilder classes
    for URL manipulation, but it may also be useful on its own. The remaining
    classes provide supporting functions for HTTPBuilder and are probably only
    useful for customizing or extending HTTPBuilder functionality.</p>
